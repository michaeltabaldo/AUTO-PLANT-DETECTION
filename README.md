# AUTO-PLANT-DETECTION



Plant Detection Robot

Introduction

This project is aimed at creating a robot that can scan seed trays and detect any dead or defective plants, and automatically replace them. The robot is designed to help greenhouse owners, nurseries, and horticulturists manage their plants more efficiently and effectively.

Requirements

An Arduino microcontroller
An Adafruit Peripheral Interface Controller (PAC)
A Raspberry Pi or equivalent single-board computer
A camera (e.g. Raspberry Pi Camera Module or USB webcam)
Servo motors to handle the seed tray and seed replanting mechanism
Motor drivers to control the servo motors
A plant detection algorithm (e.g. using computer vision techniques such as image segmentation)
Features

Automatically scans seed trays and detects dead or defective plants
Automatically replaces dead or defective plants with new, healthy ones
Easy to set up and use
Can be integrated with other plant management tools (e.g. plant monitoring systems)
Usage

Connect the hardware components as described in the Requirements section.
Install the necessary software libraries (e.g. OpenCV, NumPy, etc.).
Train the plant detection algorithm on a dataset of images of live and dead/defective plants.
Upload the code to the Arduino using the Adafruit PAC.
Run the plant detection and replacement script on the Raspberry Pi.
Conclusion

The Plant Detection Robot is a powerful tool for greenhouse owners, nurseries, and horticulturists to manage their plants more efficiently and effectively. By automating the process of detecting dead or defective plants and replacing them, the robot can save time and increase the overall health and productivity of the plants.
